# test-task-unity
Unity 2020.3.40f1

Application for android. A circle is displayed on the stage.
When you click on any point of the screen - the circle moves alternately through all the clicked points. 
The trajectory of the movement of the object is displayed using a Line Renderer.
There are coins and spikes on the field. The circle can collect coins and display their amount in the corner.
If the circle hits a spike, it bursts and a restart screen is shown. 
If the circle has collected all the coins on the stage, then a screen with a victory and a restart button is shown.
